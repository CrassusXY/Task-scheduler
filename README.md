# Task scheduling algorithm

## Given task
My task was to implement process scheduling algorithm with diffrent strategies.

https://kcir.pwr.edu.pl/~witold/opsys/opsysB_23.html

## Running the program
After cloning the repository, all you need to do is compile it. I tested the compilation using g++ for c++2a. Later you can run the program using 

```./main.out A B C < file```.

Where:

A -> strategy

B -> number of processors

C -> quantum of time

file -> example in link given above.
